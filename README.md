# 🎌 Anime Recommendation System

## 🧠 About the Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple yet effective content-based recommendation system for anime lovers. Using anime descriptions, genres, and other textual metadata, the system finds and recommends anime titles that are most similar to a user's favorite show.

## It utilizes:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) to preprocess and analyze text data
- CountVectorizer for feature extraction
- Cosine Similarity to compute similarities between anime titles

This project is ideal for understanding the fundamentals of recommender systems, vector space models, and text processing in data science.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – data manipulation & analysis
- Scikit-learn – CountVectorizer, cosine similarity
- NLTK – text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Recommender Systems – content-based filtering
- Feature Engineering – converting text to numeric features
- Similarity Metrics – cosine similarity for recommendation
- NLP – basic text handling and representation
- Data Science Workflow – problem formulation, preprocessing, modeling, and output
